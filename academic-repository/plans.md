# Academic Blockchain Repository ‚Äì Delivery Plan

Last updated: 2025-10-20 (Session 3)

## 1. Vision Snapshot

- Build a DAO-driven academic repository that enables wallet/DID based access, proposal governance, and verifiable research asset sharing across labs.
- Deliver an MVP within three months (by 2026-01-20) that satisfies the Functional Requirements (Auth, DAO, Assets, Collaboration, Admin) and Non-Functional Requirements outlined in the specification.
- Maintain a unified TypeScript stack (Next.js, Hardhat, Prisma) and ensure Polygon Amoy testnet compatibility.

## 2. Milestones & High-Level Scope

## 4. Current Iteration (Sprint 2025-10-20 ‚Üí 2025-10-31)

| Area          | Task                                                                                                                     | Owner | Status  | Notes                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tooling       | Initialize Next.js App Router project under `src/app` with Tailwind, RainbowKit, wagmi, Chakra UI, and base layout/page. | TBD   | ‚úÖ Done | Layout, providers, and hero landing scaffolded with wallet connect UI.                                                |
| Tooling       | Set up Hardhat project with TypeScript support, OpenZeppelin dependencies, sample contracts, and scripts structure.      | TBD   | ‚úÖ Done | Contracts skeleton + Hardhat config, ignition module, deploy script ready.                                            |
| Tooling       | Configure Prisma schema aligned with data model, connect to Supabase/Postgres via env vars, generate migrations.         | TBD   | ‚úÖ Done | Prisma schema established, env template updated, client generated (`npx prisma generate`).                            |
| Tooling       | Add linting, formatting, and Husky/pre-commit (ESLint, Solhint optional) to enforce code quality.                        | TBD   | ‚úÖ Done | `core.hooksPath` points to `.githooks/pre-commit` which runs `npm run lint:staged`; fallback instructions documented. |
| Tooling       | Verify toolchain via `npm install`, `npm run lint`, and `npx hardhat compile`.                                           | TBD   | ‚úÖ Done | Dependency tree resolves with wallet-sdk override; lint & Hardhat compile succeed.                                    |
| Documentation | Draft README sections for setup, environment variables, and development commands.                                        | TBD   | ‚úÖ Done | README.md covers architecture, commands, env vars, API scaffolding.                                                   |

## 5. Upcoming Backlog (Sequenced)

1. Wallet DID Auth: implement signature challenge, session tokens, and VC verification APIs (F-Auth-1/2/3).
2. DAO Governance: finalize contracts, voting weight logic, proposal execution with timelock (F-DAO-1‚ÜíF-DAO-4).
3. Research Assets: IPFS upload service, ArtifactRegistry registration, review/comment flows (F-Asset-1‚ÜíF-Asset-3).
4. Collaboration Layer: recruitment posts, activity feed, notifications (F-Collab-1‚ÜíF-Collab-3).
5. Administration & Monitoring: dashboards, logging, metrics (F-Admin-1/2).
6. Security Hardening: VC storage encryption, contract audits, rate limiting, static analysis.

## 6. Risks & Mitigations

- **VC Integration Complexity** ‚Äì Engage SpruceID early; mock VC flows locally before live integration.
- **Blockchain Event Indexing** ‚Äì Establish queue workers and event listeners during M1; consider The Graph as stretch.
- **IPFS Reliability** ‚Äì Use web3.storage with redundancy, cache metadata in Supabase.
- **Timeline Creep** ‚Äì Maintain backlog grooming, keep MVP scope tight, defer non-critical features.

## 7. Deliverable Tracking

- Plans.md to be updated at the end of each working session reflecting task status changes.
- Each milestone completion requires demo, test evidence, and documentation updates per repository guidelines.
